🚀 **Introducing TRACE Protocol v0.1.0**

We're excited to announce the first public release of TRACE Protocol - an open standard for trusted records of autonomous computation events.

**The Challenge:**
As AI agents become more powerful, organizations need frameworks to ensure accountability, traceability, and governance.

**Our Solution:**
TRACE Protocol defines a unified model — Action → Policy → Evidence — for recording, auditing, and governing autonomous computation.

**Key Features:**
✅ Propose Actions with oversight requirements
✅ Enforce Policies for approvals and validations  
✅ Collect Evidence for verifiable results
✅ Build complete accountability trails

**Available Now:**
🐍 Python SDK: `pip install traceprotocol`
📦 TypeScript SDK: `npm install @trace-labs/client`

**Resources:**
🌐 Website: https://traceprotocol.org
📚 Documentation: https://traceprotocol.org/spec.html
💻 Repository: https://github.com/trace-protocol/trace-protocol

This is just the beginning. We're building the foundation for accountable AI that organizations can trust.

**Title:** 🚀 TRACE Protocol v0.1.0 - Open Standard for Accountable AI Agents

**Post:**

Hey r/MachineLearning! 👋

We just released the first public version of **TRACE Protocol** - an open standard for trusted records of autonomous computation events.

**The Problem:**
AI agents are getting incredibly powerful, but there's a growing need for accountability frameworks. How do we ensure AI actions are traceable, auditable, and governed?

**Our Approach:**
TRACE Protocol defines a unified model: **Action → Policy → Evidence**

- **Propose Actions** - Define autonomous intents that require oversight
- **Enforce Policies** - Require approvals, validations, or constraints  
- **Collect Evidence** - Log verifiable results and artifacts
- **Audit Everything** - Build complete accountability trails

**What's Available:**
- 🐍 Python SDK: `pip install traceprotocol` 
- 📦 TypeScript SDK: `npm install @trace-labs/client`
- 🖥️ Reference server implementation
- 📚 Complete documentation and examples

**Quick Example:**
```python
from trace_client import TraceClient, Actor

trace = TraceClient(endpoint="http://localhost:8787")
decision = trace.propose(
    type="send_email",
    actor=Actor(kind="agent", name="mail-bot"),
    target="mailto:user@example.com",
    params={"subject": "Hello", "body": "World!"}
)
```

**Resources:**
- Website: https://traceprotocol.org
- GitHub: https://github.com/trace-protocol/trace-protocol
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/traceprotocol/

We'd love your feedback! What do you think about this approach to AI governance?
