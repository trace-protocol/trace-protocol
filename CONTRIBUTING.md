- Describe the use case and expected behavior
- Consider backwards compatibility implications

### Code Contributions
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

## üèóÔ∏è Development Setup

## üìã RFC Process

For significant changes, we follow an RFC (Request for Comments) process:

1. **Create an RFC Issue**: Use the `rfc` label and follow the RFC template
2. **Community Discussion**: Allow time for community feedback (minimum 1 week)
3. **Implementation**: Once approved, implement the changes
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation and examples

### RFC Template
```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of the proposed change.

## Motivation
Why is this change needed? What problem does it solve?

## Detailed Design
Technical details of the implementation.

## Backwards Compatibility
How does this affect existing code?

## Implementation Plan
Step-by-step implementation approach.

## Alternatives Considered
Other approaches that were considered and why they were rejected.
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Coverage
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Test error conditions and edge cases

### Test Structure
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Example Test Structure
```typescript
describe('TraceClient', () => {
  describe('propose', () => {
    it('should return decision with approval requirement', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const client = new TraceClient({ endpoint: 'http://localhost:8787' });
      
      // Act
      const decision = await client.propose({
        type: 'send_email',
        actor: { kind: 'agent', name: 'test-bot' }
      });
      
      // Assert
      expect(decision.status).toBe('requires_approval');
    });
  });
});
```

## üìù Code Style

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Add docstrings for all public functions and classes

### General
- Use conventional commit messages
- Keep functions focused and small
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write self-documenting code

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. **Create Branch**: Create a feature branch from `main`
2. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes with tests
3. **Update Documentation**: Update README, examples, or API docs as needed
4. **Submit PR**: Create a pull request with a clear description
5. **Code Review**: Address feedback from maintainers
6. **Merge**: Once approved, maintainers will merge your changes
